## What?

SOBE is a neural network based off of the YOLO model to detect the locations of
buckets within an image. It was originally used in the 2017 Bunnybots
competition.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train SOBE is available in the
[SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/bucket-dataset](https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/bucket-dataset)
repository. Feel free to contribute more images and labels!
